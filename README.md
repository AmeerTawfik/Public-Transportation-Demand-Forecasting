# Public-Transportation-Demand-Forecasting
An Introduction To The Project. "Background"

* Forecasting transportation demand is important for multiple purposes such as staffing, planning, and inventory control. The public transportation system in Santiago de Chile has gone through a major effort of reconstruction. In this context, a business intelligence competition took place in October 2006, which focused on forecasting demand for public transportation. This case is based on the competition, with some modifications.

Problem Description.

* A public transportation company is expecting an increase in demand for its services and is planning to acquire new buses and to extend its terminals. These investments require a reliable forecast of future demand. To create such forecasts, one can use data on historic demand. The companyâ€™s data warehouse has data on each 15-minute interval between 6:30 and 22:00, on the number of passengers arriving at the terminal. As a forecasting consultant, you have been asked to create a forecasting method that can generate forecasts for the number of passengers arriving at the terminal.

Available Data.

* Part of the historic information is available in the file bicup2006.csv. The file contains the historic information with known demand for a 3-week period, separated into 15-minute intervals, and dates and times for a future 3-day period (DEMAND = NaN), for which forecasts should be generated (as part of the 2006 competition).

What Is The Expected Content Of This Project?

* We will mainly create a model/method that produces accurate forecasts.
